# Using pass in an if-else Statement

# Example 1: Placeholder in an if block
'''
Imagine you're designing a feature for a user management system. 
You know you'll need special handling for administrators, but you haven't implemented that 
logic yet.
'''
user_role = "admin"

if user_role == "admin":
    # TODO: Implement admin-specific features later
    pass
else:
    print("Standard user access.")

print("Program continues...")

'''
Output (for user_role = "admin"):
Program continues...

Output (for user_role = "guest"):
Standard user access.
Program continues...
'''



# Example 2: Placeholder in an else block
'''
Sometimes, you only need to act on a specific condition, and if that condition isn't met, 
you simply want the program to continue without any specific action.
'''
temperature = 25 # Celsius

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's getting hot! Turn on the AC.")
else:
    # No action needed if temperature is not too high
    pass

print("Temperature check complete.")

'''
Output: Temperature check complete.
'''



# Example 3: Using pass in an elif chain
'''
You can use pass within any part of an if-elif-else chain to mark sections that are yet 
to be implemented or require no action.
'''
user_level = 2

if user_level == 1:
    print("Welcome, Basic User!")
elif user_level == 2:
    # Future development: Implement special features for Level 2 users
    pass
elif user_level == 3:
    print("Welcome, Premium User! Enjoy all features.")
else:
    print("Invalid user level.")

print("User login flow concluded.")

'''
Output: User login flow concluded.
