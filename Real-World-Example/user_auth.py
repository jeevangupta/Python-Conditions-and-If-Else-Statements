'''
Scenario: Granting access based on username and password, and then defining permissions.
'''
'''
Explanation:
The initial if statement with an and operator checks both username and password for authentication.
Upon successful login, a nested if-elif-else structure (or a single if-elif-else if user_type 
was retrieved directly) determines the user's authorization level and guides them to the 
appropriate section of the application.

stored_username = "admin_user"
stored_password = "secure_password123"

# Simulate user attempting to log in
entered_username = input("Username: ")
entered_password = input("Password: ")

if entered_username == stored_username and entered_password == stored_password:
    print("Login successful!")
    user_type = "administrator" # Or retrieve from a database

    if user_type == "administrator":
        print("You have full administrative privileges.")
        # Code for admin dashboard (placeholder for more complex logic)
    elif user_type == "editor":
        print("You have content editing privileges.")
        # Code for editor dashboard (placeholder)
    else:
        print("You have standard user privileges.")
        # Code for regular user dashboard (placeholder)
